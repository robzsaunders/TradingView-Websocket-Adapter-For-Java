# TradingView-Websocket-Adapter-For-Java
A simple websocket adapter to allow you to stream live data back from tradingview's website via java.

For now because of recaptcha you need to grab your auth token manually from your webbrowser to make the connection.

I'm sure there's a way to sniff out the token from the network traffic but that's for another day or for someone else to implement!
